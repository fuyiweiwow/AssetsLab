# AssetsLab Minimal Prototype

Target engine: Godot 4.6.2.

This prototype is intentionally UI-free. It is a command-line validated gameplay slice for:

- four-direction movement;
- eight-frame walk animation;
- collision against arena walls;
- one bomb with a short fuse and blast feedback;
- QQTang-style oversized-head neutral base as the current runtime skin: shared torso, arms, lower-body, feet, plus male/female head layers.
- deterministic front-facing ear and eye/blush layers selected by an appearance seed.

Body source rule: new horizontal walk work starts from the recommended neutral
base `../walk-base-4way-male-4frame-sheet.png`. The current eight-frame review
candidate is `assets/characters/generated/recommended_base_horizontal_layer_fix_v1/`.
The later `female_adventurer_reference_mannequin_v1_adapted` output is a redraw
comparison fixture and must not be treated as the recommended base.

The generated front/back vertical movement candidate is kept separately at
`assets/characters/generated/body_vertical_update_v1/runtime/`; it is a review
candidate and does not replace the current runtime body. The complete reference
package on the `history0731` branch contains diagonal timing strips, but the
prototype remains four-direction until that contract is stable.

The latest automatic vertical preview is published through the snapshot server
when `capture_walk_gif.ps1 -VerticalCandidate -VerticalOnly` is run. The
four-direction clothed style experiment from the external pixel-art skill is
also preview-only and is stored under
`assets/characters/generated/skill_pixel_art_experiment_v1/`.

The new skeleton-first walk workflow is independent of the older body
candidates. Its current first gate is a front-view static skeleton. Run:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_front_skeleton_stage.ps1
```

This uses the Godot console executable with `--headless`, writes
`test_output/skeleton_pipeline/front_base.png`, and must pass before the
eight-frame leg loop is started.

The current active step is the leg-only front-view loop. Run:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_front_leg_cycle_stage.ps1
```

It writes eight independent captures plus
`test_output/skeleton_pipeline/front_legs.gif`. Pelvis, arms, torso, and head
must remain static in this step.

The next isolated step adds only the pelvis bob over those accepted leg frames:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_front_pelvis_bob_stage.ps1
```

It writes eight captures plus `test_output/skeleton_pipeline/front_pelvis_bob.gif`.
The pelvis moves vertically by at most 6px peak-to-peak; the head and arms stay
static, and each foot position must exactly match stage 2.

The final front-view skeleton step adds only opposite arm swings:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_front_arm_swing_stage.ps1
```

It writes eight captures plus `test_output/skeleton_pipeline/front_arm_swing.gif`.
Hands must remain below their shoulders and on their own side of the center
axis; all accepted stage-3 lower-body values remain unchanged.

The first side-view gate is deliberately static:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_side_skeleton_stage.ps1
```

It writes `test_output/skeleton_pipeline/side_base.png`. The capture must show
one right-facing profile, a shared foot baseline, and explicit front/rear limb
depth before the side-view leg loop is created.

The next isolated side step is the leg-only loop:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_side_leg_cycle_stage.ps1
```

It writes eight captures plus `test_output/skeleton_pipeline/side_legs.gif`.
F0/F4 are contact frames; only the rear leg lifts during F1–F3 and only the
front leg lifts during F5–F7. The pelvis and arms remain static.

The next side step adds only the pelvis bob:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_side_pelvis_bob_stage.ps1
```

It writes eight captures plus `test_output/skeleton_pipeline/side_pelvis_bob.gif`.
The pelvis moves vertically by at most 6px peak-to-peak while all side-leg foot
coordinates and upper-body coordinates remain unchanged.

The final side-view step adds only counterphased arms:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_side_arm_swing_stage.ps1
```

It writes eight captures plus `test_output/skeleton_pipeline/side_arm_swing.gif`.
The arms are opposite each other and counterphased to the legs; all accepted
side pelvis, foot, and depth-order keys remain unchanged.

The back-view pelvis stage retains the accepted back-leg foot coordinates and
adds only a vertical 6px peak-to-peak pelvis bob:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_back_pelvis_bob_stage.ps1
```

The final back-view stage adds only the counterphased left/right arm swing:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_back_arm_swing_stage.ps1
```

Both scripts write eight captures and a GIF under
`test_output/skeleton_pipeline/`. The back arms stay below their shoulders and
on their own side of the center axis; the accepted lower-body coordinates stay
unchanged.

The left-facing profile is the exact joint mirror of the accepted right-facing
cycle, and the four-direction review confirms shared head/neck anchors,
pelvis phase, and foot baseline across all eight frames:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_left_mirror_stage.ps1
.\tools\capture_four_direction_anchor_review.ps1
```

The next active gate draws only neutral geometric body blocks over that
accepted four-direction motion. It is a 2D render guide for later art (or
3D-guided redraw), not a production sprite:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_neutral_body_block_stage.ps1
```

The following calibration locks the shared head center and neck point while
the lower body moves. It exports the same eight-frame four-direction review
with a cyan registration overlay:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_calibrated_head_attachment_stage.ps1
```

## Skeleton Pipeline Status

Paused after calibrated head attachment. Remaining: male/female variants and
modular face-hair-clothing layers.

## 3D Guide G0

The offline Blender guide starts with a single static neutral mannequin and
four orthographic cameras. It is a pose/depth/registration source for later
pixel authoring only; the Godot runtime still uses transparent 2D layers.
The contract is stored at
`assets/characters/generated/skeleton_walk_pipeline_v1/3d_guide_v1/camera_contract.json`.
It locks a 256 x 256 guide render to the 64 x 64 runtime frame with a shared
head center `(32,16)`, neck `(32,25)`, and foot baseline `y=60`.

Blender 4.5.0 is installed portably at `E:\env\Blender\blender.exe`. Rebuild
the source `.blend`, four transparent reference views, and contact sheet with:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_3d_guide_g0.ps1
```

The generated review images are ignored under `test_output/3d_guide_g0/`; the
reproducible `.blend`, contract, builder, and validator are tracked. G1 will
add the accepted eight-frame walk and export separate silhouette, part-ID, and
depth reference passes before any final pixels are drawn.

Controls:

- `WASD` or arrow keys: move.
- `Space`: place one bomb.

Append `--female` to run the same prototype with the female-presenting base.
Append `--compact` to use the isolated compact-stride candidate assets.
Append `--appearance-seed=12345` to select a repeatable face/ear combination.
Use `-BaseFeatures` on the test scripts to validate the fixed directional
`base_features_v1` set before enabling randomization.

Run from the repository root. The test scripts resolve Godot in this order: `-GodotPath`, `GODOT_BIN`/`GODOT_PATH`, `godot`/`godot4` on `PATH`, then the legacy adjacent `Godot-4.6.2` directory:

```powershell
$env:GODOT_BIN = 'E:\Path\To\Godot_v4.6.2-stable_win64_console.exe'
.\tools\run_headless_tests.ps1 -Female

# Or pass a different local installation for one run:
.\tools\run_headless_tests.ps1 -GodotPath 'E:\Other\Godot\godot.exe' -Female
```

The verified CC0 RGS right-facing walk reference can be loaded into the Godot
smoke test with:

```powershell
.\tools\run_headless_tests.ps1 -RebuildHead -RebuildBody -RgsWalkReference -AppearanceSeed 20260730
```

`-RgsWalkReference` activates the eight-frame RGS motion reference through an
isolated runtime slot. It is not the final character style; the next body pass
will redraw our own art against its pose timing.

Generate a hidden-window W/A/S/D capture and GIF from the repository root:

```powershell
.\tools\capture_walk_gif.ps1
```

Add `-Female` to capture the female-presenting base, `-Compact` to capture the compact-stride candidate, `-RgsWalkReference` to capture the open-source motion reference, or `-MilestoneBodyRight` to capture the frozen pixel-project milestone directly.
Add `-RebuildHead` to capture the calibrated `rebuild_atlas_v1_runtime/male` head on the current body.
Combine it with `-LatestGeneratedBody` to validate the latest generated body
adapter under `assets/characters/generated/female_adventurer_reference_mannequin_v1_adapted/`.
Use `-VerticalCandidate -VerticalOnly` to capture only the generated front/back
vertical candidate, without mixing it with the four-direction runtime body.
Add `-RightOnly` with `-MilestoneBodyRight` to capture only the eight-frame right-facing milestone loop and avoid mixing other direction assets.

Both test entry points generate a fresh random appearance package under
`prototype/test_output/random_appearance/` before starting Godot. The package
contains the selected seed, a composited 4 x 8 walk atlas, individual frames,
and a preview. Pass `-AppearanceSeed 12345` to reproduce one package exactly.
When `-BaseFeatures` is used, the test additionally validates and runs the
non-random base feature set.

The capture script resolves Python from `-PythonPath`, `PYTHON_BIN`, PATH, or the local `.venv`/sibling fallback. Pillow is required for GIF conversion.

Build the candidate vertical frames and structure-preserving skin previews from
the repository root:

```powershell
python .\tools\build_body_vertical_update.py
python .\tools\recolor_body_palettes.py
```

The palette tool writes `light`, `warm`, and `deep` variants while preserving
the source frame size and alpha mask byte-for-byte. These are preview assets;
they are not wired into the player yet.

`tools/generate_random_appearance.py` creates the ignored per-run package;
`tools/validate_random_appearance.py` verifies that the package frames are
complete, composited, and consistent with the seed/gender rule.

The Godot process uses `--headless` with the Windows/OpenGL renderer, so no editor or game window is presented even if the capture is started repeatedly. The resolver requires a `_console.exe` build; it fails closed if a GUI binary has no unambiguous console sibling. PNG frames and the GIF are written to `prototype/test_output/`; this directory is ignored by Git. The GIF is `prototype/test_output/movement_walk.gif`.

The headless test runner validates all 192 frames across six chibi layers and
512 face/ear component frames before launching Godot. It checks fixed frame
size, layer seam ranges, the shared foot baseline, transparent rear appearance
rows, and deterministic seed selection. Add `-Compact` to validate and run the
compact variant.

The generated walk sheets are source assets. The processed transparent atlases
under `assets/characters/chibi/` are the runtime inputs for this prototype. The
runtime stack is independent `Feet` + `LowerBody` + `Arms` + `Torso` + `Ear` +
male/female `Head` + `Face` layers. The first appearance pass has no nose or
mouth; hair and clothing remain future layers.

Open `preview/index.html` for the persistent local asset preview. It uses
project-tracked files instead of `test_output/`, so the page remains usable
after temporary test artifacts are cleaned.

Publish a timestamped snapshot and start a read-only LAN server for phone
review from the repository root:

```powershell
.\tools\serve_preview.ps1 -SnapshotName rear_ear_fix
```

The command prints one or more `http://<LAN-IP>:8765/snapshots/<snapshot>/`
addresses. Each run creates a separate snapshot under the ignored
`prototype/preview/snapshots/` directory, so a previous change can be compared
later without being overwritten.

Stop the background preview server with:

```powershell
.\tools\stop_preview.ps1
```

Preview access rule: when a person needs to inspect a visual result, use the
Tailscale URL printed by the preview server. Local file links, `localhost`,
and temporary chat attachments are not reliable as the only access method.
Whenever Tailscale is used, proactively include the complete preview URL in
the response. If nobody requests visual review, do not generate an additional
preview.

The current preview includes the recommended horizontal leg-depth correction
candidate, the older redraw adapter as a comparison, the calibrated head
runtime, and the vertical candidate. Historical proxy GIFs, retired body
candidates, and old skeleton experiments are intentionally excluded from the
new page.

Use the interactive component calibration page at
`http://<Tailscale-IP>:8765/calibrate.html`. It can move the face and ear
parts independently for all four directions and save the calibration JSON to
`prototype/preview/calibration/latest.json`.
